    <p>Humans have always looked up into the night
        sky and dreamed about space.</p>
    <p>In the latter half of the 20th century,
        rockets were developed that were powerful
        enough to overcome the force of gravity to
        reach orbital velocities, paving the way for
        space exploration to become a reality.</p>
    <p>In the 1930s and 1940s, Nazi Germany saw the
        possibilities of using long-distance rockets as
        weapons. Late in World War II, London was
        attacked by 200-mile-range V-2 missiles, which
        arched 60 miles high over the English Channel
        at more than 3,500 miles per hour. After World
        War II, the United States and the Soviet Union
        created their own missile programs.</p>
    <p>On Oct. 4, 1957, the Soviets launched the
        first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, into
        space. Four years later on April 12, 1961,
        Russian Lt. Yuri Gagarin became the first human
        to orbit Earth in Vostok 1. His flight lasted
        108 minutes, and Gagarin reached an altitude of
        327 kilometers (about 202 miles).</p>
    <p>The first U.S. satellite, Explorer 1, went
        into orbit on Jan. 31, 1958. In 1961, Alan
        Shepard became the first American to fly into
        space. On Feb. 20, 1962, John Glenn’s historic
        flight made him the first American to orbit
        Earth.</p>
    <h3>Landing On The Moon</h3>

            Landing on the moon: Apollo 12 launches for
            second moon landing Nov. 14, 1969.

    <p>“Landing a man on the Moon and returning him
        safely to Earth within a decade” was a national
        goal set by President John F. Kennedy in 1961.
        On July 20, 1969, astronaut Neil Armstrong took
        “one giant leap for mankind” as he stepped onto
        the Moon. Six Apollo missions were made to
        explore the Moon between 1969 and 1972.</p>
    <p>During the 1960s, unmanned spacecraft
        photographed and probed the Moon before
        astronauts ever landed. By the early 1970s,
        orbiting communications and navigation
        satellites were in everyday use, and the
        Mariner spacecraft was orbiting and mapping the
        surface of Mars. By the end of the decade, the
        Voyager spacecraft had sent back detailed
        images of Jupiter and Saturn, their rings, and
        their moons.</p>
    <p>Skylab, America’s first space station, was a
        human-spaceflight highlight of the 1970s, as
        was the Apollo Soyuz Test Project, the world’s
        first internationally crewed (American and
        Russian) space mission.</p>
    <p>In the 1980s, satellite communications
        expanded to carry television programs, and
        people were able to pick up the satellite
        signals on their home dish antennas. Satellites
        discovered an ozone hole over Antarctica,
        pinpointed forest fires, and gave us
        photographs of the nuclear power plant disaster
        at Chernobyl in 1986. Astronomical satellites
        found new stars and gave us a new view of the
        center of our galaxy.</p>
    <h3>Space Shuttle</h3>
    <p>In April 1981, the launch of the space
        shuttle Columbia ushered in a period of
        reliance on the reusable shuttle for most
        civilian and military space missions.
        Twenty-four successful shuttle launches
        fulfilled many scientific and military
        requirements until Jan. 28,1986, when just 73
        seconds after liftoff, the space shuttle
        Challenger exploded. The crew of seven was
        killed, including Christa McAuliffe, a teacher
        from New Hampshire who would have been the
        first civilian in space.</p>

            The Space Shuttle was the first reusable
            spacecraft to carry people into orbit;
            launch, recover, and repair satellites;
            conduct cutting-edge research; and help
            build the International Space Station.

    <p>The Columbia disaster was the second shuttle
        tragedy. On Feb. 1, 2003, the shuttle broke
        apart while reentering the Earth’s atmosphere,
        killing all seven crew members. The disaster
        occurred over Texas, and only minutes before it
        was scheduled to land at the Kennedy Space
        Center. An investigation determined the
        catastrophe was caused by a piece of foam
        insulation that broke off the shuttle’s
        propellant tank and damaged the edge of the
        shuttle’s left wing. It was the second loss of
        a shuttle in 113 shuttle flights. After each of
        the disasters, space shuttle flight operations
        were suspended for more than two years.</p>
    <p>Discovery was the first of the three active
        space shuttles to be retired, completing its
        final mission on March 9, 2011; Endeavour did
        so on June 1. The final shuttle mission was
        completed with the landing of Atlantis on July
        21, 2011, closing the 30-year space shuttle
        program.</p>
    <p>The Gulf War proved the value of satellites
        in modern conflicts. During this war, allied
        forces were able to use their control of the
        “high ground” of space to achieve a decisive
        advantage. Satellites were used to provide
        information on enemy troop formations and
        movements, early warning of enemy missile
        attacks, and precise navigation in the
        featureless desert terrain. The advantages of
        satellites allowed the coalition forces to
        quickly bring the war to a conclusion, saving
        many lives.</p>
    <p>Space systems continue to become more and
        more integral to homeland defense, weather
        surveillance, communication, navigation,
        imaging, and remote sensing for chemicals,
        fires, and other disasters.</p>

    <h3>International Space Station</h3>

            The International Space Station.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The International Space Station is a
        research laboratory in low Earth orbit. With
        many different partners contributing to its
        design and construction, this high-flying
        laboratory has become a symbol of cooperation
        in space exploration, with former competitors
        now working together.</p>
    <p>The station has been continuously occupied
        since the arrival of Expedition 1 in November
        of 2000. The station is serviced by a variety
        of visiting spacecraft: the Russian Soyuz and
        Progress; the American Dragon and Cygnus; the
        Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle; and formerly
        the Space Shuttle and the European Automated
        Transfer Vehicle. It has been visited by
        astronauts, cosmonauts, and space tourists from
        17 different nations.</p>
    <p>Space launch systems have been designed to
        reduce costs and improve dependability, safety,
        and reliability. Most U.S. military and
        scientific satellites are launched into orbit
        by a family of expendable launch vehicles
        designed for a variety of missions. Other
        nations have their own launch systems, and
        there is strong competition in the commercial
        launch market to develop the next generation of
        launch systems.</p>

    <p>Modern space exploration is reaching areas
        once only dreamed about. Mars is focal point of
        modern space exploration, and manned Mars
        exploration is a long-term goal of the</p>
    <p>United States. NASA is on a journey to Mars,
        with a goal of sending humans to the Red Planet
        in the 2030s.</p>
    <p>NASA and its partners have sent orbiters,
        landers, and rovers, increasing our knowledge
        about the planet. The Curiosity Rover has
        gathered radiation data to protect astronauts,
        and the MARS 2020 Rover will study the
        availability of oxygen and other Martian
        resources.</p>
