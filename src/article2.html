      <p>In April 1981, the launch of the space
        shuttle Columbia ushered in a period of
        reliance on the reusable shuttle for most
        civilian and military space missions.
        Twenty-four successful shuttle launches
        fulfilled many scientific and military
        requirements until Jan. 28,1986, when just 73
        seconds after liftoff, the space shuttle
        Challenger exploded. The crew of seven was
        killed, including Christa McAuliffe, a teacher
        from New Hampshire who would have been the
        first civilian in space.</p>

          The Space Shuttle was the first reusable
          spacecraft to carry people into orbit;
          launch, recover, and repair satellites;
          conduct cutting-edge research; and help
          build the International Space Station.

    <p>The Columbia disaster was the second shuttle
      tragedy. On Feb. 1, 2003, the shuttle broke
      apart while reentering the Earth’s atmosphere,
      killing all seven crew members. The disaster
      occurred over Texas, and only minutes before it
      was scheduled to land at the Kennedy Space
      Center. An investigation determined the
      catastrophe was caused by a piece of foam
      insulation that broke off the shuttle’s
      propellant tank and damaged the edge of the
      shuttle’s left wing. It was the second loss of
      a shuttle in 113 shuttle flights. After each of
      the disasters, space shuttle flight operations
      were suspended for more than two years.</p>
    <p>Discovery was the first of the three active
      space shuttles to be retired, completing its
      final mission on March 9, 2011; Endeavour did
      so on June 1. The final shuttle mission was
      completed with the landing of Atlantis on July
      21, 2011, closing the 30-year space shuttle
      program.</p>
    <p>The Gulf War proved the value of satellites
      in modern conflicts. During this war, allied
      forces were able to use their control of the
      “high ground” of space to achieve a decisive
      advantage. Satellites were used to provide
      information on enemy troop formations and
      movements, early warning of enemy missile
      attacks, and precise navigation in the
      featureless desert terrain. The advantages of
      satellites allowed the coalition forces to
      quickly bring the war to a conclusion, saving
      many lives.</p>
    <p>Space systems continue to become more and
      more integral to homeland defense, weather
      surveillance, communication, navigation,
      imaging, and remote sensing for chemicals,
      fires, and other disasters.</p>
