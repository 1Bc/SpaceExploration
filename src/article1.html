    <p>“Landing a man on the Moon and returning him
        safely to Earth within a decade” was a national
        goal set by President John F. Kennedy in 1961.
        On July 20, 1969, astronaut Neil Armstrong took
        “one giant leap for mankind” as he stepped onto
        the Moon. Six Apollo missions were made to
        explore the Moon between 1969 and 1972.</p>

    <p>During the 1960s, unmanned spacecraft
        photographed and probed the Moon before
        astronauts ever landed. By the early 1970s,
        orbiting communications and navigation
        satellites were in everyday use, and the
        Mariner spacecraft was orbiting and mapping the
        surface of Mars. By the end of the decade, the
        Voyager spacecraft had sent back detailed
        images of Jupiter and Saturn, their rings, and
        their moons.</p>
    <p>Skylab, America’s first space station, was a
        human-spaceflight highlight of the 1970s, as
        was the Apollo Soyuz Test Project, the world’s
        first internationally crewed (American and
        Russian) space mission.</p>
    <p>In the 1980s, satellite communications
        expanded to carry television programs, and
        people were able to pick up the satellite
        signals on their home dish antennas. Satellites
        discovered an ozone hole over Antarctica,
        pinpointed forest fires, and gave us
        photographs of the nuclear power plant disaster
        at Chernobyl in 1986. Astronomical satellites
        found new stars and gave us a new view of the
        center of our galaxy.</p>
