  <p>The International Space Station is a
    research laboratory in low Earth orbit. With
    many different partners contributing to its
    design and construction, this high-flying
    laboratory has become a symbol of cooperation
    in space exploration, with former competitors
    now working together.</p>
  <p>The station has been continuously occupied
    since the arrival of Expedition 1 in November
    of 2000. The station is serviced by a variety
    of visiting spacecraft: the Russian Soyuz and
    Progress; the American Dragon and Cygnus; the
    Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle; and formerly
    the Space Shuttle and the European Automated
    Transfer Vehicle. It has been visited by
    astronauts, cosmonauts, and space tourists from
    17 different nations.</p>

  <p>Space launch systems have been designed to
    reduce costs and improve dependability, safety,
    and reliability. Most U.S. military and
    scientific satellites are launched into orbit
    by a family of expendable launch vehicles
    designed for a variety of missions. Other
    nations have their own launch systems, and
    there is strong competition in the commercial
    launch market to develop the next generation of
    launch systems.</p>
