    <p>Modern space exploration is reaching areas
      once only dreamed about. Mars is focal point of
      modern space exploration, and manned Mars
      exploration is a long-term goal of the</p>
    <p>United States. NASA is on a journey to Mars,
      with a goal of sending humans to the Red Planet
      in the 2030s.</p>
    <p>NASA and its partners have sent orbiters,
      landers, and rovers, increasing our knowledge
      about the planet. The Curiosity Rover has
      gathered radiation data to protect astronauts,
      and the MARS 2020 Rover will study the
      availability of oxygen and other Martian
      resources.</p>
